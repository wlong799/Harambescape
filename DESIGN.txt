## GENRE ##
2-D Scrolling Platformer (i.e. Super Mario Brothers)

## NAME ##
Harambescape

## BACKGROUND ##
It was just another normal day in the gorilla enclosure at the
Cincinatti Zoo, when suddenly, a human child appeared...

Playing as Harambe the gorilla, you must survive the perils of the zoo
and escape the workers who are trying to kill you, in order to save the
child and reunite him with his mother.

This project is dedicated to Harambe (RIP 1999 - 2016).

## GOAL ##
Progress through the level, avoiding zoo workers with guns, and gaining
upgrades through the power of passerby who take pictures of you and 
increase your status as a meme. Reach the end of the level without dying
and face the final boss (the mom) to win the game.

## MECHANICS ##
Game will behave similarly to other 2D scrolling platformer games. You
must move forwards through the level, while avoiding workers trying to
shoot you. You can stop the workers by throwing bananas at them. There
will be passerby throughout the level. If you go near them, they will
take a picture of you, giving you points for future upgrades (examples:
speed, health restore, banana power). In the end, there will be a boss
fight against the mom, and if you defeat her for being so careless, the
child will be saved and you can escape the zoo.

## LEVELS/MODES ##
Main level is going through the zoo, which will have cops who shoot at
you, and various platforms to jump on, similar to Mario. Boss fight 
will just be against the mother at the end.

There will be an upgrade screen as well, where you can use points you've 
gained from becoming an iconic meme to increase your power.
